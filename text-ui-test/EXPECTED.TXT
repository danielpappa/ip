I can help you create an agenda to manage your tasks.
Simply use one of the below listed commands to proceed:
	• todo: adds a task with a DESCRIPTION
	• deadline /: adds a task with DESCRIPTION and /DEADLINE
	• event / /: adds a task with DESCRIPTION, /STARTDATE and /ENDDATE
	• mark: marks the task with the provided INDEX as done
	• unmark: resets the task with the provided INDEX as not done
	• count: returns the total number of tasks in the agenda
	• delete: deletes the task with the provided INDEX
	• clear: deletes all tasks within the agenda
	• list: lists all current entries in the agenda
	• bye: exits the program
